# Finite-Automata-Emulation
For this project, I will be Emulating a Finite automata based on the teachings of my Automata course. The programming language used in the project is Java

## How it works 
In this program, the code will ask the user to select states just as the one a Finitie Automata(FA) uses to create their states. Once the user selects the amount of states they want, then they will be prompted to insert the integer values that will be used to move into states.
  
Be aware that this code can only have a max of 3 states (0,1,2) since its hardcoded for demonstration purposes. When the compiler asks for symbols, it asks for how many values to you want in each row, so if you press 3 then if you enter 1,2,3 then array[1][i] will have the values 1,2, 3 inside there. The final state will always be 2 since its hardcoded and below is an output with 1 value accepted.
